# Super-tic-tac-TOE
A super tic tac toe game played in terminal coded in C++ (if anyone wants to run it on Windows there is a line that doesnt work cuz idk how to clear the console on windows)

My first c++ project from learning programming in Ourense. Very proud, coded in codeblocks beacause i NEED to learn it due to it being mandatory on this university. Helped me learn about classes, a little bit about pointers, although i didn't end up using them and a LOT about classes and protected, public and private variables and methods and headers / libraries.
